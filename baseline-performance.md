### Project : Semantic-Segmentation-of-Satellite-Imagery  
### November 6th, 2022

Milestone 2 is directod to perform Baseline Semantic. To execute the program we were provded with the seed repo. The seed repo was 228_seemantic_segmentation_of_ariel_imagery_using_unet. It provided with all the necessary code to go through the images and masks and rescale and print 10 segmented images from validation sets.

From kaggle were able to get data containing the images and mask of satelight images of Dubai. After downloading the contents it was uploaded to Google drive. Then through collab after installing all the dependencies and giving acess to Google drive the seed repo was able to exeute the file. Although there were some problem. We got the image and the mask image after running the seed repo but it was only printing 1 image and i mask image. After some modification using a for loop wer were able to produce the 10 images including the mask image.
